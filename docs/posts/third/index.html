<p>The idea comes from &ldquo;a quarrel&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I asked my boyfriend if he would like to try to fall in love with the robot. He actually replied &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; without thinking.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it, maybe because I am his girlfriend, but even more terrifying is that I feel that he is optimistic about the development of robots in the follow-up conversation. He firmly believes that one day, the robot can Have &ldquo;personality&rdquo; and learn the so-called “self-learning&quot;.</p>
<p>The first step is not to discuss ethical issues. I want to know why he is so convinced? During the conversation I found that he had no evidence. But his expectations and fears of artificial intelligence are real.</p>
<p>I have discussed the same questions and ideas with many people, and I found that they are almost always the same attitude - blind and innocent confidence and fear of future technology.</p>
<hr>
<p>Where Is The Attitude Come From?</p>
<p>Many people replied that were movies. I have seen a lot of sci-fi and artificial intelligence movies (Ex Machina , Blade Runner, Her, Transcendence, Black Mirror), and I have once again watched some classic movies in order to have sufficient evidence.</p>
<hr>
<p>My Inspiration:</p>
<p>I want to do a &ldquo;very ridiculous&rdquo; questionnaire. Of course, the participants don&rsquo;t think it is ridiculous at first, but the questionnaire has nearly one hundred questions. After the completion (the difficulty of insisting on the completion itself), the participants will start thinking. What does this question mean for him, or what is his real need?</p>
<hr>
<p>Key Points In The Question:</p>
<p>Do you want him to have robotic wisdom or human wisdom? - It depends on whether you want to be limited or infinite.</p>
<p>Why does a robot want to be with you if a robot is smarter than you? - This hypothesis comes from Hawking&rsquo;s remarks. If the wisdom of the robot can transcend humanity, then even if we are not hostile, we will be eliminated because it hinders the development of robot civilization.</p>
<p>Is the robot grid still human personality? - Decided how you think about it.</p>
<p>Memory dataization - An indelible feature of human nature: memory.</p>
<p>What can you get with a fine customization? - Maybe it&rsquo;s just missing.</p>
<p>When can robots achieve true artificial intelligence? - The key question is, when.</p>
<p>Can you pay? - I believe that most people can guess that even if it can be achieved, it will not be easily obtained.</p>
<p>Can it be destroyed? - The human self is still the most important, self-protection.</p>
<hr>
<p>My Conclusion:</p>
<p>Many people&rsquo;s concept of wise knowledge of robots is limited and naive. The problem behind this is fundamental. It is still humanistic. It is needed by people based on their own needs. The focus is still on &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; and &ldquo;humanity&rdquo;. &quot;&quot; Humanity.&quot; People have changed the problems in their own world to the carrier, and the essence remains the same.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Key Issue:
Will this day really come?</p>
<p>I asked a professional teacher in the computer department at our university. He told me that many years ago, computer scientists have proved that this is impossible with the most basic physical and mathematical knowledge.</p>
<p>Real scientists never worry about it.</p>
