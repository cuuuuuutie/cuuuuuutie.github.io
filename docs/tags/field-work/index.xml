      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really sorry that you need to move here:, I can&amp;rsquo;t upload any image in our unstable narratives blog site :(
In this week&amp;rsquo;s exploration, I mainly observed plants. I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in their &amp;ldquo;life&amp;rdquo;, daily life and life journey.
    I first continued to observe a plant I saw when I was passing by. It seemed very common, but I never noticed its change from day to night.</description>

      <description>Hi, I’m Xiaoya Sun from China, Beijing, and I’m currently on the Experimental Communication pathway.
I think I am a real indoorsy girl.
  There are very few outdoor activities in my life. I browsed my photo album and found that the only thing related to the outdoors is the sky and clouds, and then I was thinking, how boring life I am living?
  Maybe because I always feel tired when I went out.</description>
