      <description>It is a device that combines time and sound.
“Time”, “Surrender”, “Scream”, “Death”
  1984   I read this book several times. For a long time, when I was walking, taking the subway, sleeping, I was surrounded by the emotion and atmosphere in the book, I have been deep infected by Winston&amp;rsquo;s pursuit and struggle, his hope and despair. The resonance this book brings to me is not historical, but it is similar to many things in my life.</description>
