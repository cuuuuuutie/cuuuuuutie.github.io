It is a device that combines time and sound.

 “Time”, “Surrender”, “Scream”, “Death”

I read this book several times. For a long time, when I was walking, taking the subway, sleeping, I was surrounded by the emotion and atmosphere in the book, I have been deep infected by Winston's pursuit and struggle, his hope and despair. The resonance this book brings to me is not historical, but it is similar to many things in my life. This book is brilliant, and I want to make a work to pay a tribute to it, and also express some emotions that the public can feel.

I use some materials to represent what I want to express. I used the speakers to represent the sound, and different candles were placed on the heating plates, and it melted, like Winston being exhausted slowly, his consciousness and emotions finally changed. Each candle's voice were same at the end, and that was "I love big brother", we all said at the end, "I love big brother", and we were forced to acknowledge a so-called truth “2+2=5”.

"It's no matter whether two plus two equals five or three."

This may be right, maybe wrong. When things happen, we can't say 2+2=4, and even some people are educated 2+2=5 from the beginning, and these topics are like Winston's memory, is as sensitive as it can't be discussed. Politics can't be discussed, morality can't be discussed, and feminist can't be discussed, because you don't know what is right, what if you were the wrong person from the beginning?

Interaction:

I added human-computer interaction into this device. When a person walks in front of each candlestick, the ultrasonic sensor measures the distance and transmits the data to Arduino, which controls the speaker. When the distance between the person and the candlestick is less than 50 centimeters, the speaker changes its sound mode, just like asking for help to the person passed by.
