“I wanted to tell people that there was nothing wrong with it.”

“Audience friends, please take good care of me.”

“What does it feel like to look like me?” “Some people love me and some don’t.”

South Korean entertainer Sulli was found dead in her home on October 14, 2019.

"When an avalanche occurs, no snowflake is innocent."

About Sulli ’s death, what shocked me the most was that the Chinese netizen claimed that they was not the snowflake that caused the avalanche. 

What a big tragedy, what a big joke.

Sulli dead, it is "a person dead", and "not only a person dead".

Sulli is a girl who is similar to my age. I understand and feel sympathy for her depression, because I have also encountered it. It is so, I can understand how terrible and helpless to choose death in pain she was. After her death, I have been paying attention to the evaluation of this matter on the Internet, but I found that people regard this as a “thing", because she as very famous to deserves a lot of attention. But attention will sooner or later disappear, what will not? 

It should be the understanding and love that we can finally give her, and apologize.

Motivation

Keep the beauty forever in 25:

Sulli's beauty STOP in this moment, and forever.



Say more useless;

The crowd ALWAYS sober: As if they know everything, but still malignity.



Since they know everything, then say more useless.

Irony elements: Dark circles under her eyes, smile, sexy body.

About the paintings:

I have borrowed the styles of Mucha's works, such as line, decoration, drama, detail, etc. Innovation is added as well: the characteristics of Sulli's face are preserved, and the colors are brighter and modern.
 The core is to highlight BEAUTY and IRONY.
