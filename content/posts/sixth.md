Hi, I’m Xiaoya Sun from China, Beijing, and I’m currently on the Experimental Communication pathway.

I think I am a real indoorsy girl.

There are very few outdoor activities in my life. I browsed my photo album and found that the only thing related to the outdoors is the sky and clouds, and then I was thinking, how boring life I am living?

Maybe because I always feel tired when I went out. But I do like to see the world through the 3D map! Hahahahhhh…

So I really hope to take this course as an opportunity to go out and play more.

This is a plant I found fews days ago. I saw that its leaves were closed at night. I felt it very cute. When I passed by again the next day, they opened up. I think they might be cold in evenings.

I love all the cute things.
