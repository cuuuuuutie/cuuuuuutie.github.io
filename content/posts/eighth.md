I'm really sorry that you need to move here:, I can't upload any image in our unstable narratives blog site :(



In this week's exploration, I mainly observed plants. I'm very interested in their "life", daily life and life journey.

I first continued to observe a plant I saw when I was passing by. It seemed very common, but I never noticed its change from day to night. I accidentally discovered that it would close the leaves at night, and then I recorded the closing process of it, which took about an hour. I squatted on the ground and recorded it.

This is also a plant, possibly a kind of vegetable, in the backyard of my grandma's house. When I saw its shape, I thought of the waves, and its leaves were broken.

These are cucumbers that have not developed successfully. They are still hanging on the vine and the leaves that have withered, withered in different forms.

These are tomatoes that have not grown successfully. They are lying on the ground. Many of them have rotted. They had a batch of normal fruits before, but the weather was cold and they did not catch the last train.

These are leaves, and they feel like rusty metal.

Generally speaking, when I saw them, I thought of fate. They must have feelings, what that feelings can be?
